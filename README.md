## Shop and Customer Interaction - BPMN and UML Models

# Overview
This repository contains Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams representing a simple shop and customer interaction. The models aim to visualize key business processes, such as customer purchasing behavior, product selection, payment processing, and interaction flow within a shop environment.

# Contents
# BPMN Diagrams:
Visualizations of customer interactions with the shop, including the process of selecting products, making payments, and completing transactions.

# UML Diagrams:
System-level models that describe how customers and the shop's backend system interact. Includes use cases, class structures, and sequence flows.

##  Diagrams Included
# BPMN Diagrams

Customer Purchase Process: Depicts the step-by-step process of customer browsing, selecting products, and completing a purchase.
Payment Flow: Illustrates the interaction between the customer and the payment system, including decision points like payment method selection and payment validation.

# UML Diagrams

Use Case Diagram: High-level representation of customer interactions with the shop system, including browsing products, making purchases, and processing payments.
Class Diagram: Defines the structure of the system, including customer, product, and payment classes, with relationships between entities.
Sequence Diagram: Details the interactions between customer and system objects during the purchase process, from product selection to payment completion.
